<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Gary Hector Jr., a passionate individual whose love for the game of basketball has been an integral part of my identity. From the earliest days of my childhood, I found joy and purpose on the court, with each dribble and shot shaping my aspirations. Unfortunately, my journey took an unexpected turn as I faced a series of three foot surgeries that abruptly cut my basketball career short. The road was arduous, marked by the heartbreak of a torn Achilles during one of those surgeries. These setbacks ushered in a period of darkness, where I grappled with both physical pain and emotional turmoil. Yet, in the midst of depression and sadness, a new path revealed itself, leading me to discover a profound love for development</p>

<p>Amid the shadows cast by my injuries, I embarked on a journey of introspection and resilience. Through this challenging period, I navigated my way through the maze of uncertainty, and in doing so, stumbled upon a newfound passion: development. This dynamic realm, which required creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving, captured my heart. With an indomitable spirit, I embraced this challenge wholeheartedly, channeling the same dedication and determination that had fueled my basketball pursuits. Through the struggles and triumphs of web development, I found a sense of purpose that resonated as deeply as the court once did</p>

<p>Now, as I embark on this new web development class, I am excited to document this journey as a testament to resilience, growth, and reinvention. My story serves as a beacon of hope for fellow retired athletes who have faced similar abrupt endings to their athletic careers. To those individuals, I want to convey that despite the adversities, the game of life continues. It may take different forms and require new strategies, but the spirit of determination remains unwavering. By sharing my experiences, I hope to encourage others to keep fighting, to rediscover themselves, and to embrace the challenges that lie ahead. The echoes of the game that once fueled our dreams can still guide us toward new horizons.</p>
