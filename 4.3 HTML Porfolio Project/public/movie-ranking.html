<h1>The Best Movies According to Gary</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Love and Basketball </h3>
<p>This film is supperb from start to finish growing up. The sporty yet romantic aspect of it all is what makes it one of the best. Omar Epps and Sana Lathan were at the peaks of their careers and this is what set them blasting off like a rocket</p>
<h3>The Wood </h3>
<p>This 90's movie is a oldy but a goldy this movie has an amazing lineup with Nia long and Morris Chestnut just to name a few.The movie makes you laugh, cry and want to love all in one sitting i really love this beautiful film</p>
<h3>Monsters Inc</h3>
<p>I'm sure this may have taken you by suprise but honestly speaking this is a Gem! Sully and Mike were a dynamic due and they made history. I loved how they started to protect boo from the mnonsters. I also believe that there is a hidden message in monsters inc that im willing to debate anyone on! Which makes its way more deeper for me</p>
